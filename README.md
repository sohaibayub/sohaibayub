## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Galway, Ireland. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), where my research focused on data-driven approaches for context-aware sports performance assessment and web energy optimization. My research interests span several areas, including data analytics, data spaces, machine learning, and natural language processing. Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on various research projects involving sports data analytics, web optimization, wireless sensor networks, and machine learning applications in diverse fields such as Arabic OCR, biological data, and legal case prediction. In addition to my research, I have extensive teaching experience. Iâ€™ve taught various undergraduate courses at LUMS and FAST-NU, including data structures, computational problem-solving, operating systems, and advanced programming. I have also co-advised numerous senior-year projects at LUMS, integrating hands-on learning with project management methodologies. I am actively involved in academic services, reviewing journal papers, serving on program committees for international conferences, and contributing to workshops in cloud computing and high-performance computing. My academic contributions have been recognized with various awards, including travel grants and research funding. Before joining the University of Galway, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from LUMS, where I specialized in data-driven performance metrics, web energy optimization, and context-aware systems. I also completed my MS in Computer Science at LUMS with a focus on Program Analysis, and I earned my BS in Information Technology from SEECS, NUST, Islamabad, where I was involved in the High-Performance Computing Lab. Teaching and technology have always been at the core of my work, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of sharing my knowledge through academic instruction and contributing to numerous international conferences and publications.
